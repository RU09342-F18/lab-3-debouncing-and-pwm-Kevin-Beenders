# Lab 3: Timers and PWM
Pulse width modulation is a method of imitating an analog signal using a digital signal. PWM is explored in this lab by attempting to turn on and off an LED while maniupulating the signal's duty cycle. The signal can be modulated so that the brightness to a human's eyes increases logaritmically, as in each subsequent button press up to 100% duty cycle increases the apparent brightness less each time. The labs implement capture and compare registers to keep limits on the timers, and from there the CCRs determine when the LEDs are to be turned on and then off. 

Software debouncing is also tackled in this lab, which involes temporarily disabling the button that is being used as an interrupt directly after the first rising edge from it. This way, any bounces from the button that occur are not read. This disabling only happens for two microseconds, but that is all that is needed to prevent any bounce from the switch.
