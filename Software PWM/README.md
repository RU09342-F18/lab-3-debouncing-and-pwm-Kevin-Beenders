# Software PWM
Utilizing the timer modules on the dev boards, it is possible to perform pulse width modulation of signals that can be used to manipulate the signals going through different devices. In the case of this lab: an LED. the LED in question operates at 1000 Hz. In conjunction with the SMCLK, which operates at 1 MHz, that makes it  simpler as whatever number that is used in the CCR for the fixed stop point in up mode will be the frequency of the signal. From there, another CCR can be used with a value between 0 and 1000 which will determine the duty cycle. Initially, the duty cycle is set to 50%, and every subsequent button press will increase the duty cycle by 10% up unitl 100, after that, it will go back down to 0% and will icnrement from there. Visually, the brightness does not increase linearly rather logarithmically. This is because of how our eyes are programmed to view differences in brightness.  

The PWM uses two interrupts, one on the button and Timer A0 to facilitate the modulation of the signal.
